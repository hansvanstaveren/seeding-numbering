- Do not forget to use the new ../seeding, which is the combined version
- ../seeding now splits the output into groups already, the scripts here (postsplit for example) have been updated for this, test for safeties sake
- The sort -R is a sort shuffle
- postsplit script is edited afterwards, not the one run in 2022
- postsplit should be edited depending on number of groups
